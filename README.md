# cookiecutter-project

Forked and modified from [PyPSA/cookiecutter-project](https://github.com/PyPSA/cookiecutter-project).

This repository provides [cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) templates for reproducible projects.
Projects build with these templates aim at full automation, and use `Python`, `mamba`, `Git`, `Snakemake`, and `Latex` to create a PDF report out of raw data, code, and text. 

## Getting Started

Make sure you have cookiecutter installed, otherwise install it with [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

    mamba create -n cookiecutter cookiecutter -c conda-forge
    mamba activate cookiecutter

Then create a repository using:

    cookiecutter gh:open-energy-transition/cookiecutter-project

Follow the setup guide. The project will be named `[PROJECT NAME]` in the next steps.

Once the repository is created, move into the folder.

    cd [PROJECT NAME]

Create a new project on GitHub and push the new repository.

    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    gh repo create

Follow the setup guide.

Set up [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/).
